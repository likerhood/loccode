## ✨ Key Features

* 🚀 **Convenient, Standardized Evaluation Environment**

   [Provide Pre-built **Docker images**](https://hub.docker.com/r/guolianghong/omnigirl/tags), significantly simplifying the environment setup process and guaranteeing the **consistency and reproducibility** of evaluation tests.

* 🕸 **Extensive Programming Language Coverage**

   Support **Python, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript**, ensuring effective evaluation across these four major programming language ecosystems.

* 🗂️ **Rich Multimodal Input Data**

   Integrate diverse modalities (text, web content, and images), requiring evaluated models to **understand and leverage** information from all sources **to effectively resolve issues**.

* ⚒ **Automatic Environment Setup & Dataset Construction Tool** 

  We introduce **SWE-Factory**, an automatic issue-resolution benchmark construction pipeline based on a multi-agent framework. For more information and the full source code, visit: [SWE-Factory](https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory).

## 📦 Environment Setup

To get started, run the bash script below to set up the environment:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## 🚀 Running Evaluations

After setup the environment, you need to do following things to run evaluation:

1. Prepare Prediction file: Some patch files in JSONL format, each item containing:
   - `model_name_or_path`: Model Name
   - `instance_id`: Task Instance id
   - `prediction_patch`: Prediction Patch Content

    Example:
    ```json
    {
        "model_name_or_path": "agentless-v1",
        "instance_id": "prettier__prettier-12260",
        "model_patch": "diff --git ...."
    }
    ```

2. Move to omnigirl/harness, then you can run the evaluation using the following command:

   ```bash
   # required
   cd omnigirl/harness
   
   python run_evaluation.py --predictions_path <path of your prediction results> \
                            --max_workers <number of workers> \
                            --run_id <unique id number of this evaluation>
   ```

3. By default, your evaluation results will be generated in omnigirl/harness/reports.

4. For the detailed tutorial about evaluation, please refer to  [omnigirl/harness directory](./omnigirl/harness)

5. Evaluation is recommended to be run on machines with amd64 architecture, consistent with the evaluation environment in the paper.
