# gnp_random_graph(n, p, seed=None, directed=False)

# Returns a G_{n,p} random graph, also known as an Erdős-Rényi graph or a binomial graph.
# The G_{n,p} model chooses each of the possible edges with probability p.

# Parameters
# n (int) – The number of nodes.
# p (float) – Probability for edge creation.

# Returns
# G – A random graph, also known as an Erdős-Rényi graph or a binomial graph.
